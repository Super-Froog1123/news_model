                        It seems exciting to be part of a world-famous big tech that influences people’s daily lives. But discussion about whether it is an excellent choice to work in Da Chang has become controversial in recent years.

                        Despite the popularity of Da Chang working opportunities, some said their work in these companies fails to meet their expectations. Joy Su, a former intern of Tencent Beijing, said the long working hours and repetitive work in Da Chang disappointed her. “I feel like I am a tiny piece of wood in a huge fireplace. Everyday I keep this fire burning with my past experience and knowledge, but I’m not learning anything new. If I stay in Da Chang, I know sooner or later I will be used up.” said Joy Su.
